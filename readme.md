# Scout

**Work-In-Progress!** PCBs are done (I hope!), but enclosure is still baking and I need to write up proper documentation. Stay tuned.

**scout** (_/skout/_):

1. _One sent to obtain information_
2. _Jean Louise ‚ÄúScout‚Äù Finch, of Atticus Finch_
3. _The first synth from Oskitone to venture into the big ol' world of microcontrollers_

The Scout is:

- **Hackable:** Powered by an ATmega328 and can be re-programmed just like an Arduino Uno using an [FTDI Serial TTL-232 cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/70). And fully open source!
- **3D-Printable:** Besides the electronics and some common nuts and bolts, all parts can be 3D-printed. And with a width of ~160mm (about 6.3"), the Scout can fit on smaller, "mini" print beds.
- **Minimally featured:** Monophonic square wave with fixed glide and octave. 1.5 octaves of keys, a volume knob, on/off switch, headphone jack. No MIDI/CV or other IO.
- **Beginner-friendly:** All through-hole components for soldering and assembles in about 45min. Standalone, battery-powered, doesn't need a computer or external speakers to work. Fun!

## Goals

In addition to the Scout being the first microcontroller-controlled instrument from Oskitone, it would also make a fine first DIY instrument for the budding electronics hobbyist.

As such, its design is guided by a metric I'm calling "Time-to-Noise" (TTN): the time it takes from starting the kit to making music with it. The lower the better.

- Minimum number of components for reduced assembly time
- Able to print on "mini" (18x18x18cm) sized 3D printers
- Built-in speaker
- Minimum number of notes
- Volume control

~Any secondary features should be optional; circuit must function w/o them:~

- ~Line-out jack~ _Eh, easier said than done_
- ~Octave control~ _Removed!_

### 3D-Printing

(If you bought a kit with 3D-printed parts included, you can skip this!)

<!-- Download STLs of the models at [https://oskitone.github.io/apc/](https://oskitone.github.io/apc/). --> There are seven files to print:

<!-- ![Exploded CAD view of the four models](TODO) -->

| Part             | Layer Height | Supports? | Color change at height | Estimated Time |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------------------- | -------------- |
| battery_holder   | .2mm         | No        | n/a                    | 40min          |

**Notes:**

- Models don't need supports and should already be rotated to the correct orientation for printing.
- Watch the first couple layers of the enclosure pieces while printing, especially around the text engravings -- if you see bad adhesion, stop the print to remedy the situation and start again.
- If the prints aren't fitting together well, check to see that the corners aren't bulging. See if your slicer has settings for "coasting" or "linear advance."
- The switch clutch has a narrow support wall that will break off when it's done printing.

### PCB Soldering Instructions

( _Not your first electronics kit? Skip to the BOM below!_ üòÖ )

<!-- ![A soldered Scout PCB](TODO) -->

Each group of steps in the Scout's assembly has a test at the end to make sure everything is working as expected. If it doesn't work, don't fret! Look over the troubleshooting tips below. Don't move on in the instructions until you've got it working.

1. **Assemble battery pack**
   1. Insert tabbed battery contact terminals
      1. The springed contact goes to the spot with a "-".
      2. The flat, button contact goes near "+". Its button should face inward towards where the battery will be.
      3. Fold their tabs over to hold them in place.
   2. Insert wire dual contacts
      1. Again, springs go to "-" and buttons to "+".
   3. Add wire
      1. Your ribbon cable will probably have different colors, and that's okay! A common convention is to use the darker color for "-" and the lighter one for "+".
      2. With the battery holder oriented so its "+" contact tab is on the left and "-" on the right, thread the 7" ribbon cable through the hitch on the left, about halfway though, and then split the bottom pair of wires.
      3. Thread the darker wire of the now separated pair through the channel on the bottom of the battery holder and up through the right hitch.
      4. Strip 1/4" of insulation off that right wire and solder to its contact tab.
      5. Cut the wire on the left to meet its tab, then strip and solder it.
      6. Separate and strip the other side of wires. Make sure they don't touch!
      7. Insert three AAA batteries, matching their "+" and "-" sides to the battery holder's labels.
      8. _Using a multimeter, measure the total voltage on those two wires. It should measure the sum of the three indivual batteries' voltages. When done, remove batteries to prevent accidentally draining them if the exposed wires touch._
2. **Power up**
   1. Solder LED at **D1**
      1. The LED has four pins for three different colors plus ground. The longest one is to ground and it goes to the hole that has a line coming out of it.
      2. Get the LED as vertically close to the PCB as reasonable; it doesn't have to be flat against PCB but does need to be straight up and down -- no leaning!
   2. Solder sliding toggle switch **SW1** and resistor **R1** (220).
      - Make sure the switch is flat against the PCB.
   3. Wire battery pack to **BT1**
      1. Thread the other side of the ribbon cable connected to the battery pack up through the hole near **BT1**, then strip and solder in place. Make sure the "+" and "-" wires are going to the right places.
   4. _Add the batteries back. Toggling **SW1** should now light one color of the LED! Power off before continuing soldering._
3. **Boot the microcontroller**
   1. Solder capacitors **C1** (220uF) and **C2** (.1uF), oscillator **Y1**, and resistors **R2** (220) and **R5** (10k).
      - **C1** has polarity. Match its white side to the white side of its footprint.
   2. Solder **U1** socket. It will have a dimple at one end, which should match the footprint on the PCB.
   3. Carefully insert **ATmega328**. It will have a dimple (and/or a small dot in a corner), which should match the socket.
   4. _Turn the power switch back on, and the LED should blink a new, different color a couple times. This lets you know that the ATmega is booted up and ready. Power off._
4. **Get logical**
   1. Solder an SPST switch to **SW2**.
      - **_Make sure the switch is absolutely flat against the PCB before soldering all of its pins._** One way to do this is to solder one pin to hold it in place, then use one hand to push it into the PCB while melting the solder with your other hand; if there's any gap there it should pop in. Visually inspect to make sure it's good, then repeat with the opposite pin. Then inspect and do the remaining pins. It takes time but is worth it.
   2. _With power on, press the switch. The LED should light just like it does on boot! Power off._
5. **Make some noise**
   1. Solder volume pot **RV1**, resistor **R3** (10k), and headphone jack **J1**.
      - Make sure **RV1** and **J1** are pushed all the way into PCB before soldering all the way.
   2. Connect your headphones into the headphone jack. Push firmly until it clicks in all the way.
   3. _With power on, turn up the volume with the potentiometer and press **SW2**. You should hear a tone from the headphones. Power off._
6. **Get loud**
   1. Solder capacitors **C5** (220uF) and **C6** (.1uF) and resistor **R4** (1m).
      - Make sure **C5**'s polariy matches its footprint, just like **C1**.
   2. Wire speaker to **LS1**.
      1. Thread remaining ribbon cable through hole.
      2. Strip insulation and solder to **LS1**.
      3. Strip and solder the other ends to the speaker, matching the "+" and "-" sides.
   3. Solder socket **U2**. Match its dimple to the footprint, just like **U1**.
   4. Insert **LM386** chip, again making sure its inserted the correct way.
   5. _Power on, unplug your headphones, and press the switch. It should be playing out of the speaker now. Power off._
7. **More notes**
   1. Solder the remaining tactile 16 switches, **SW3** through **SW18**.
      - We want them all as flat against the PCB as **SW2**, so take your time here. They should line up perfectly!
   2. _Power on and press each. They should all play different notes out of the speaker. Power off._
8. **Get louder (Optional. Skip if it's already loud enough for you!)**
   1. Solder cap **C3** (1uF).
      - Match polarity.
   2. _Power on and press some switches. The speaker should now be louder now! Power off._
9. **Prep for hacking (Optional. Skip if you don't plan on changing the code.)**
   1. Solder **J2** header and **C4** (.1uF) cap.
      - Try to get **J2**'s pins parallel to the PCB and sticking straight out.
   2. _See "Hacking" section below on how to use this!_

#### Troubleshooting

- Turn the PCB over and check all solder joints. A majority of problems are caused by insufficient or errant soldering. Familiarize yourself with what a good joint looks like in the [Adafruit Guide To Excellent Soldering](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering).
- Are all chips in the right orientation? Each has a notch/dimple that should match the footprint outline on the PCB.
- Do the batteries have enough power? The three batteries should have a total voltage of 3.6 to 4.5 volts.
- If there‚Äôs buzzing, check for any metal scraps stuck to the speaker‚Äôs magnet.
- If some keys are touchy or behaving weird, check to see that they're inserted all the way and flat against the PCB.

### Final Assembly

1. Assemble top
   1. Slide **square nuts** into nut locks on **enclosure top**. It'll be snug, but they'll fit! Use needle-nose pliers or a similar tool to push them in until their holes line up with those on the enclosure.
   2. Add the **keys**. Notice that 1) their rail has cavities on the sides that fit onto matching aligners on the enclosure and 2) the front of the keys have a cutout that matches an endstop on the enclosure, which will prevent the keys from being pressed too far down or being pulled up. Guide the keys down onto the aligners and into the endstop. It'll take some careful wiggling!
2. Assemble bottom
   1. Align **PCB** onto the **enclosure bottom**, nestled into its aligners.
   2. Pop the **speaker** and **battery holder** into their cavities on the **enclosure bottom**. Orient them so that their wires are relatively contained within the space there and not poking up into where the keys will be.
   3. Add the **keys mount rail** onto its aligners and on top of the PCB.
   4. Add the **switch clutch** into its spot around the switch.
3. Finish
   1. Align **enclosure top** onto **enclosure bottom** and snap the two halves together. Try to make sure the **keys mount rail** and **keys** stay aligned as you do this.
   2. Fix **knob** onto the volume pot shaft, aligning its dimple to to the little marker on the top of the pot shaft.
   3. Slide two **machine screws** up through the bottom of the **enclosure bottom**.
      - If they don't insert easily, you may have something misaligned inside. Pop the enclosure back open (see below for help) and make sure the **PCB**, **keys mount rail**, and **keys** are all lined up correctly.
   4. Tighten **screws** on bottom. Not too tight!

All done!

### Opening the enclosure

Later, when you need to change the batteries (or maybe just want to admire your hard work!), you'll need to open the enclosure back up.

1. Unscrew bottom **machine screws**. They don't have to come all the way out, just loosen.
2. Pop off the volume **knob**. A flathead screwdriver (or similar tool) may help provide leverage.
3. Insert that same flat tool on the UART cavity or the horizontal gap on the back right, then wedge the enclosure apart.

### Optional: Hacking!

Ready to experiment and get your hands dirty with some code?

1. Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and follow their instructions to install whatever drivers you'd need for an Arduino Uno.
2. With the Scout's power off, use an [FTDI Serial TTL-232 cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/70) to connect the Scout's UART header to your computer.
   1. The Scout's UART header has "B" and "G" labels on its sides to match the cables Black and Green wires.
   2. The cable provides power to the Scout, so it should now be on and working normally
   3. Don't turn the power switch on, as the extra voltage from the batteries can damage the ATmega!
3. In the IDE, under "Tools->Board", select "Arduino Uno". Under "Tools->Port" select your new cable; its exact name will depend on the brand. If you're not sure which it is, try unplugging and restarting the IDE -- whichever it was will no longer be listed, so you'll know which it is when reconnecting and restarting.
4. Download the code from this repo and load `arduino/scout.ino` in the Arduino IDE. You'll also need the `CircularBuffer` and `Keypad` libraries, so open up "Tools->Manage libraries" and search for those to install them.
   1. Try uploading this to the Scout by going to "Sketch->Upload". If it works, after 10 seconds or so, it will blink just like it does when you switch its power on. If it doesn't work, the IDE will print out an error that you can google to find out how to fix.
   2. Experiment with the `octave` and `glide` values at the top of `scout.ino` and observe how your Scout has changed its sound.
5. "Blink"
   1. The Arduino IDE has a default program called "Blink" (available in "File->Examples->Basics->Blink").
   2. After uploading, the Scout won't be playable anymore but one of the colors on the RGB LED should blink off and on.
   3. Try changing the delay values in the example to make it blink faster or slower.
   4. Follow the steps above to bring the original Scout code back.

Once you're comfortable with the Arduino code and really want to expand on what the Scout can do, take a look at the unpopulated HACK header on the PCB. It exposes all the unused pins on the ATmega328 that are safe to use for whatever you'd like:

| HACK         | ATmega pins | Description                                         |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| VCC          | n/a         | Voltage from batteries or USB                       |
| A0-A5        | 23-28       | Analog pins                                         |
| D12          | 18          | There's only one unused digital pin, and this is it |
| SWC, SW1-SW3 | 16; 6,11,12 | Unused spots in the key matrix                      |
| GND          | n/a         | Ground                                              |
