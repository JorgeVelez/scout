# Scout

Work in progress

## Goals

Quickest "Time-to-Noise" (TTN) from starting kit to making noise with it:

* Minimum number of components for reduced build time
* Ideally 0 off-board connections; no ribbon cable,
* Able to print on "mini" (18x18x18cm) sized 3D printers
* Built-in speaker
* Minimum octave of notes
* Volume control

Any secondary features should be optional; circuit must function w/o them:

* Line-out jack
* Octave control

Doesn't need to include but documentation should address:

* CV, MIDI or other IO
* Polyphony
* Wave types besides square, envelopes, portamento, vibrato
