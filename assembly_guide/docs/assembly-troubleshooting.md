- If the screws are hard to insert into the enclosure bottom, don't force them but look to see if the **keys mount rail** is in the way. It may have come loose from its aligners.
- A note is stuck on? The key mounting screw(s) may be too tight. Try loosening until the note turns off.
- A note turns off when pressing another near it? The key mounting screw(s) may be too loose. Try tightening.
- If the volume knob is hard to press onto its pot shaft, don't force it -- that could permanently damage the potentiometer. Try filing the inside of the knob's shaft cavity. If printing at home, make sure you've got the most recent STL models.
