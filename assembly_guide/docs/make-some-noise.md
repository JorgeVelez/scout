## Steps

   - Make sure **RV1** and **J1** are pushed all the way into PCB before soldering all the way.
2. Connect your headphones into the headphone jack. Push firmly until it clicks in all the way.

## Test

With power on, turn up the volume with the potentiometer and press **SW2**. You should hear a tone from the headphones. Power off.
