With the PCB done soldering and working, it's time to finish the job! Let's put the rest together.

## Finish the job

:::note
Check out the [Assembly troubleshooting](assembly-troubleshooting) section if you run into any trouble here.
:::

1. Assemble top
   1. Slide **square nuts** into nut locks on **enclosure top**. It'll be snug, but they'll fit! Use needle-nose pliers or a similar tool to push them in until their holes line up with those on the enclosure.
   2. Add the **keys**. Notice that 1) their rail has cavities on the sides that fit onto matching aligners on the enclosure and 2) the front of the keys have a cutout that matches an endstop on the enclosure, which will prevent the keys from being pressed too far down or being pulled up. Guide the keys down onto the aligners and into the endstop. It'll take some careful wiggling!
   3. Glide the **keys mount rail** onto its aligners.
2. Assemble bottom
   1. Align **PCB** onto the **enclosure bottom**, nestled into its aligners.
   2. Pop the **speaker** into its cavity on the **enclosure bottom** with the speaker's shiny side up. Pop the **battery holder** into its cavity too. Orient them so that their wires are relatively contained within the space there and not poking up into where the keys will be.
   3. Add the **switch clutch** into its spot around the switch.
3. Finish
   1. Align **enclosure top** onto **enclosure bottom** and snap the two halves together. Try to make sure the **keys mount rail** and **keys** stay aligned as you do this.
   2. Fix **knob** onto the volume pot shaft, aligning its dimple to to the little marker on the top of the pot shaft.
   3. Slide two **machine screws** up through the bottom of the **enclosure bottom**.
      - If they don't insert easily, you may have something misaligned inside. Pop the enclosure back open (see below for help) and make sure the **PCB**, **keys mount rail**, and **keys** are all lined up correctly.
      - These screws may seem unnecessary &mdash; after all, all the notes can be played and the enclosure is snapped together &mdash; but using them will cut down on mechanical "click" noises from playing. Don't skip them!
   4. Cautiosly tighten **screws** on bottom but not too tight! If you overtighten, the keys will get held down.

All done!
