- Turn the PCB over and check all solder joints. A majority of problems are caused by insufficient or errant soldering. Familiarize yourself with what a good joint looks like in the [Adafruit Guide To Excellent Soldering](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering).
- Are all chips in the right orientation? Each has a notch/dimple that should match the footprint outline on the PCB.
- Do the batteries have enough power? The three batteries should have a total voltage of 3.6 to 4.5 volts.
- If there’s buzzing, check for any metal scraps stuck to the speaker’s magnet.
- If some keys are touchy or behaving weird, check to see that they're inserted all the way and flat against the PCB.
- If you're hearing an unwanted hum from the speaker when the Scout isn't being played, verify all .1uF caps are soldered well. It may also be from noise added by long wires, so try to use the recommended wire lengths in this guide.
